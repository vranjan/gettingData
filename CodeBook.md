 In the following are listed 68 variable names in the tidy data. I have removed characters "-" and "()" from the orginal variable names (variable 1-66). I have also replaced "t" with "time" and "f" with "frequency" in the original variable names to provide more descriptive variable names in the final tidy data set. Finally variables 67 and 68 are "Activity" and "Subject" that represent activity level of a subject. The detailed information on the data can be found at "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones"
